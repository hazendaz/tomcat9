This project takes tomcat 9.x.x zip and expands on it to provide the following.

- Tomcat-slf4j-logback integration
- Logback Access integration
- Psi Probe Management Tool
- Java Metro Integration
- All tomcat webapps items removed
- Setup for https (currently disabled)
- Setup for psi probe
- And if you want, drop back in tomcat wars and those are pre-configured as well but intentionally left out
